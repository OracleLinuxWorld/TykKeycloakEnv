### 1 Keycloak only available on the localhost loopback address 
By default Keycloak binds to the localhost loopback address 127.0.0.1. Thatâ€™s not a very useful default if you want the authentication server available on your network. To bind Keycloak to a specific interface you can start Keycloak with -b flag as shown below
```
$ standalone.sh -b 192.168.0.5
```
In addition you can change the default by editing the  profile configuration file (standalone.xml or domain.xml depending on your operating mode) as shown below
```
    <interfaces>
        <interface name="management">
            <inet-address value="${jboss.bind.address.management:127.0.0.1}"/>
        </interface>
        <interface name="public">
            <inet-address value="${jboss.bind.address:127.0.0.1}"/>
        </interface>
    </interfaces>
```
